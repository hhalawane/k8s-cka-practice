If you are using etcd as your datastore, follow these steps to back it up:

**Set Environment Variables:** First, set the environment variables required for etcdctl, which is the command-line interface for interacting with etcd.

```
export ETCDCTL_API=3
```

**Create the Backup:**
```
etcdctl snapshot save /path/to/backup.db \  
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \  
  --cert=/etc/ssl/etcd/client.pem \  
  --key=/etc/ssl/etcd/client-key.pem \  
  --cacert=/etc/ssl/etcd/ca.pem
```
- Replace `/path/to/backup.db` with your desired backup path.
- Ensure the paths to your certificates are correct.

**Verify the Backup:**
You can verify the backup by running:

```
etcdctl snapshot status /path/to/backup.db
```

## Backup Kubernetes Resources

In addition to backing up etcd, it’s wise to back up your Kubernetes resources (deployments, services, etc.):

```
kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o yaml > kubernetes-backup.yaml
```

This command retrieves all resources in your cluster and saves them in YAML format, making it easier to restore specific resources if necessary.

# Step 2: Check Current Cluster Status

Before upgrading, check the status of your cluster to ensure all components are functioning correctly.

# Verify Node Status

Run the following command:

```
kubectl get nodes
```

This command will list all nodes in your cluster along with their current status. Ensure that all nodes are in the `Ready` state before proceeding with the upgrade.

# Check Current Kubernetes Version

It’s also essential to note the current version of Kubernetes running in your cluster:

```
kubectl version
```

This command will show the client and server version. The server version is the version running in your cluster, and you’ll need to remember this as you plan your upgrade.

# Step 3: Upgrade kubeadm

# Update Package Repository

Before upgrading kubeadm, update your package repository to get the latest available packages:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

This command ensures that your package manager has the latest information on available packages.

# Upgrade kubeadm

Upgrade kubeadm to the desired version:

```
sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=<desired-version>
```

Replace `<desired-version>` with the version number you want to upgrade to (e.g., `1.23.0`). This command installs the specified version of kubeadm.

# Step 4: Plan the Upgrade

After upgrading kubeadm, you should plan your upgrade to assess compatibility and available upgrades.

# Execute the Plan Command

Run the following command:

```
sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
```

This command analyzes the current state of your cluster and provides information about available upgrades. It will inform you of any potential issues and provide recommendations for the upgrade process.

# Review the Upgrade Plan

Pay attention to the output, as it will detail the components that will be upgraded, the version being upgraded to, and any necessary actions you need to take. Ensure you follow any recommendations provided in the output.

# Step 5: Upgrade the Control Plane

Now that you have planned the upgrade, it’s time to upgrade the control plane components.

# Execute the Upgrade Command

Run the command to upgrade the control plane:

```
sudo kubeadm upgrade apply <desired-version>
```

This command will upgrade the API server, controller manager, and scheduler components. Follow any prompts provided during the upgrade process.

# Important Notes

- **Downtime:** Be aware that upgrading the control plane may lead to temporary downtime for the Kubernetes API server. Plan the upgrade during a maintenance window to minimize the impact on users.

# Upgrade kubelet and kubectl

After upgrading the control plane, you also need to upgrade kubelet and kubectl on the master node:

```
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=<desired-version> kubectl=<desired-version>
```

# Restart Kubelet

After upgrading kubelet, you need to restart the kubelet service to apply the changes:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload  
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```
The `daemon-reload` command tells systemd to reload its configuration, and `restart` applies the updated kubelet.

# Step 6: Upgrade Worker Nodes

Once the control plane is upgraded, you can proceed to upgrade the worker nodes.

# Upgrade Process for Worker Nodes

You should upgrade the worker nodes one by one to avoid disrupting workloads. Follow these steps for each worker node:

## Drain the Node

Begin by draining the node you want to upgrade. This command will safely evict workloads from the node:

```
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
```
- Replace `<node-name>` with the name of the node you’re upgrading. The `--ignore-daemonsets` flag ensures that daemon sets continue running during the drain.

## Upgrade kubeadm on Worker Node

SSH into the worker node and repeat the package update and upgrade for kubeadm:

```
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=<desired-version>
```

## Upgrade the Worker Node

Next, run the upgrade command:

```
sudo kubeadm upgrade node
```

This command upgrades the node’s control plane components and prepares it to run the new version.

## Upgrade kubelet and kubectl

Similar to the control plane, upgrade kubelet and kubectl:

```
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=<desired-version> kubectl=<desired-version>
```
## Restart Kubelet

Restart the kubelet service on the worker node:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload  
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

## Uncordon the Node

After the upgrade is complete, allow workloads to be scheduled on the node again:

```
kubectl uncordon <node-name>
```
# Step 7: Verify the Upgrade

Once all nodes have been upgraded, it’s crucial to verify the success of the upgrade.

# Check Node Status

Run the following command to verify the status of all nodes:

```
kubectl get nodes
```

Ensure all nodes are in the `Ready` state, indicating that they are functioning correctly.

# Verify Kubernetes Version

Confirm the Kubernetes version on all nodes:

```
kubectl version
```

This command will display the client and server versions. Ensure that the server version matches the desired version.

# Step 8: Cleanup

After successfully upgrading the cluster, you can clean up any unnecessary resources.
